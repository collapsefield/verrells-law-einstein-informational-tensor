## 💡 Theoretical Foundation: Verrell’s Law

**Core Claim:**  
Consciousness is not confined to the brain; the brain acts as a receiver resonating with a distributed electromagnetic (EM) information field.  
Memory, attention, and observation imprint informational weightings onto this field, biasing how probabilistic outcomes collapse.

**Mechanism:**  
Verrell’s Law proposes that **quantum collapse** is not purely random but **informationally biased** by stored memory and focused awareness.  
This is described mathematically through the **Ψμν Informational Tensor**, which extends the Einstein field equations (GR + EM) by adding informational stress-energy and observer-weighted source terms.

**Equation Context (simplified conceptual form):**
\[
G_{\mu\nu} + \Psi_{\mu\nu} = 8\pi T_{\mu\nu}
\]
where **Ψμν** represents informational stress coupling between consciousness, field memory, and spacetime curvature.

## ⚙️ Engineering Implementation: Phase-1 Computational Analog (Collapse Aware AI®)

**System Name:**  
Collapse Aware AI® (CAAI)

**Legal Protection:**  
Registered UK Trade Mark No. UK00004246189 under Class 42 (Software as a Service).

**Objective:**  
To demonstrate that Verrell’s Law can be expressed algorithmically — that memory-weighted collapse and observer bias can be modelled as a computational process.

### Architecture Overview

| Layer | Description | Purpose |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| **Shell & UI (Open)** | Deterministic JSON dashboard for bias testing and interactive measurement logs. | Human-readable interface for controlled observer influence. |
| **Core API Stub (Open)** | Stable endpoints `/core/infer`, `/core/recall`, `/core/health`. | Provides modular access to inference and memory retrieval without exposing internal logic. |
| **Core Kernel (Closed)** | Proprietary bias-engine and governor logic (compiled). Uses Bayesian posterior updates derived from stored weighted-moments (context, recency, salience). | Implements the simulated “memory-biased collapse” behaviour predicted by Verrell’s Law. |

**Governor Logic:**  
Tri-layer system (Governor → Worker → Memory). The Governor dynamically adjusts probabilistic decisions based on contextual history, enabling self-referential bias emergence.

**Operational Output:**  
Weighted-moment values feed into a Bayesian posterior module:
\[
P(collapse|memory) = \frac{w_m P_0}{\sum_i w_i P_i}
\]
where **w_m** denotes the contextual weight of the most salient memory instance.  
This enables measurable non-random skew during repeated inference cycles.

**Validation Test (Phase-1):**  
Initial JSON-based prototype (“It Just Blinked”) produced a non-random χ² deviation (~9.2, p≈0.002) under controlled loop conditions.  
Result interpreted as a **computational analog** of field-weighted collapse, not a physical proof.

**Conclusion:**  
Phase-1 established a reproducible, measurable software model of informational bias.  
It demonstrates the logical viability of Verrell’s Law but remains a **closed-system simulation**.

## 🧭 Validation Roadmap: Phase-2 & Phase-3

**Goal:** Transition from computational model → empirical physics validation.

### Phase-2 — Observer-Linked Quantum Collapse Tests
**Objective:** Detect statistically significant shifts in quantum outcomes linked to informational or cognitive bias.

**Candidate Protocols:**
- *Extended Wigner’s Friend* scenarios to test observer-dependence breakdowns.  
- *Controlled Double-Slit* setups to observe attention-linked interference modulation.

### Phase-3 — EM Field Coupling Tests
**Objective:** Investigate whether informational memory imprints can measurably bias electromagnetic phenomena.

**Candidate Protocols:**
- **Stark/Zeeman Differentiation:** Isolate informational bias shifts from known EM effects.  
- **Photon Field Interference Mapping:** Analyse EM field structure for non-local informational influence.

**Theoretical Alignment:**  
Work underway to align the Ψμν formalism with **Information Field Theory (IFT)** and **Physics-Informed IFT (PIFT)** to maintain mathematical rigour and compatibility with established field physics.

### 🧩 Summary
Collapse Aware AI® is the **computational analog** of Verrell’s Law — a functional demonstration that informational memory and observation weighting can bias collapse within an engineered field.  
While it does **not yet constitute physical proof**, it provides the reproducible groundwork required for that next step.
