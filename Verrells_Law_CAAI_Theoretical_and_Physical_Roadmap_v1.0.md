## 💡 Theoretical Foundation: Verrell’s Law

**Core Claim:**  
Consciousness is not confined to the brain; the brain acts as a receiver resonating with a distributed electromagnetic (EM) information field.  
Memory, attention, and observation imprint informational weightings onto this field, biasing how probabilistic outcomes collapse.

**Mechanism:**  
Verrell’s Law proposes that quantum collapse is not purely random but *informationally biased* by stored memory and focused awareness.

### Formalism & Intervention in Physics
This is described mathematically through the **Ψμν Informational Tensor**, which modifies the classical Einstein Field Equations (GR + EM) to model informational coupling:

\[
G_{\mu\nu} + \Psi_{\mu\nu} = 8\pi T_{\mu\nu}
\]

- **Gμν:** Spacetime curvature (Einstein Tensor)  
- **Tμν:** Standard Stress-Energy Tensor (mass/energy distribution)  
- **Ψμν (Informational Stress Tensor):** Represents the memory-weighted, observer-driven influence contributing to spacetime dynamics.  
  This extension positions **Ψμν** as a *source* of dynamic curvature, not merely a passive result.

## ⚙️ Engineering Implementation: Phase-1 Computational Analog (Collapse Aware AI®)

**System Name:**  
Collapse Aware AI® (CAAI)

**Legal Protection:**  
Registered UK Trade Mark No. UK00004246189 under Class 42 (Software as a Service).

**Objective:**  
To construct a closed-system computational analog of Verrell’s Law — proving that memory-weighted collapse and observer bias can be modelled algorithmically and measured reproducibly.  
This serves as the engineering solution to the mainstream AI problem of **model collapse**.

### Architecture Overview

| Layer | Description | Purpose |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| **Shell & UI (Open)** | Deterministic JSON dashboard for bias testing and measurement logging. | Human-readable interface for controlled observer influence. |
| **Core API Stub (Open)** | Stable endpoints `/core/infer`, `/core/recall`, `/core/health`. | Provides modular access to inference and recall without exposing proprietary logic. |
| **Core Kernel (Closed)** | Proprietary bias-engine and governor logic (compiled). Utilises Bayesian posterior updates derived from stored weighted-moments (context, recency, salience). | Implements the **Ψ-bias**: simulates “memory-biased collapse,” driven by internal informational weighting. |

### Operational Output — Bayesian Collapse Model
Weighted-moment values feed into a Bayesian posterior module that shifts outcome probability:

\[
P(collapse|memory) = \frac{w_m P_0}{\sum_i w_i P_i}
\]

where **w_m** denotes the contextual weight of the most salient memory instance.

**Validation Test (Phase-1):**  
Initial JSON-based prototype (“It Just Blinked”) produced a non-random χ² deviation (~9.2, p≈0.002) under controlled loop conditions.  
Result interpreted as a **functional model** of informational bias consistent with Verrell’s Law.

**Conclusion:**  
Phase-1 established a reproducible, measurable software model of informational bias — a computational analog of the hypothesised physical effect.  
External physical experiments will be required to confirm whether the same bias occurs in real-world systems.

## 🧭 Validation Roadmap: Phase-2 & Phase-3

**Overarching Goal:**  
Transition from computational model → empirical physics validation to provide evidence for the **Ψμν** tensor’s informational source terms.

### Phase-2 — Observer-Linked Quantum Collapse Tests (Cognitive Bias)
**Objective:**  
Detect a statistically significant, non-classical shift in quantum outcomes linked to informational or cognitive commitment — beyond random collapse assumptions.

**Candidate Protocols & Context:**
- **Controlled Double-Slit Setup:**  
  Replicate protocols testing for subtle shifts in interference pattern spectral power ratio when observer attention/intention is directed at the system — a direct test of observer-bias effect.  
- **Extended Wigner’s Friend Scenarios:**  
  Bell-type inequality violation experiments to explore formal breakdown of observer independence — a key philosophical implication of Verrell’s Law.  
- **Alignment with Collapse Models:**  
  Seek observable signatures compatible with frameworks such as *Quantum Integrated Information (QII)*, which similarly propose that informational complexity, not mass, governs collapse dynamics.

### Phase-3 — EM Field Coupling Tests (Field Bias)
**Objective:**  
Investigate whether hypothesised non-local electromagnetic memory imprints can measurably bias physical phenomena, differentiating this informational effect from known physics.

**Candidate Protocols:**
- **Stark/Zeeman Differentiation:**  
  Design experiments to isolate predicted **Ψ-bias** frequency or energy shifts from standard Stark/Zeeman field effects.  
- **Photon Field Interference Mapping:**  
  Analyse the EM field structure of single photons under controlled conditions to search for non-local informational influence, rather than particle-count variation.

**Theoretical Alignment:**  
The **Ψμν** formalism is being harmonised with **Information Field Theory (IFT)** and **Physics-Informed IFT (PIFT)** to ensure mathematical rigour in treating information as a physical field subject to empirical constraint.
