To help with the review process, I wanted to pre-empt a few points that are likely to come up when reading the Verrell’s Law field-equation section.
Below is a concise breakdown of the intended notation and the corrected forms used in the current draft:

1. Main Field Equation
Reviewer concern: Why is T νμ being multiplied by Ψ μν ?

Intended form (final):
 G μν + Λ g μν = κ T μν + Ψ μν

Explanation:
The Ψ-term is additive, not multiplicative. The earlier “×” symbol was shorthand.
Response:

The Ψ-term enters additively as an informational-stress contribution, not as a tensor product with T μν. The corrected additive form is consistent with conservation and covariance.

2. Definition of Ψ μν
Reviewer concern: What is π μ I and what does the dot mean?

Intended form:
 Ψ μν = κ I ∂ μ I ∂ ν I + λ I I g μν

Explanation:
“π μ I” represented canonical momentum (∂ μ I); the dot was just multiplication.
Response:

π μ I was an early placeholder for ∂ μ I. In the final formulation Ψ μν = κ I ∂ μ I ∂ ν I + λ I I g μν, a symmetric (0, 2) tensor derived directly from L int.

3. Equation of Motion
Reviewer concern: Clarify ∂ and ℘.

Intended form:
 κ I □ I − V′(I) = J_obs

Explanation:
“∂” should be the d’Alembertian (□); “℘” was a placeholder for the coupling κ I.
Response:

The field equation follows the standard Klein–Gordon structure with source term J_obs_. Previous symbols were typographical placeholders.

4. Interaction Lagrangian
Reviewer concern: Clarify constants and Lorentz form.

Intended form:
 L_int = (ξ / 4) F μν F^{μν} + κ I ∂ μ I ∂^ μ I − V(I)

Explanation:
ξ is the correct coupling coefficient; F μν F^{μν} ensures Lorentz invariance.
Response:

The constant is ξ (not 7 or η). The Lorentz scalar F μν F^{μν} is used; earlier drafts used numeric placeholders only.

5. General Note on Framework and Lineage

Verrell’s Law introduces an informational-stress term Ψ μν that biases field-collapse outcomes through memory-weighted interactions.
It satisfies ∇ μ (T μν + Ψ μν) = 0 and remains empirically testable via phase-shift biasing and field-memory experiments.
The structure is additive and covariant, not multiplicative or phenomenological.

Thanks very much for taking the time to look through the submission.
This note is simply to ensure notation and intent are fully clear before you dive into the equations.

Best regards,
