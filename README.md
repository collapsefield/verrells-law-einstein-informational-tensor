Verrell‚Äôs Law ‚Äî Einstein Informational Tensor Framework

Formal physics framework extending Einstein‚Äôs Field Equations with the Œ® ŒºŒΩ Informational Field Tensor ‚Äî the mathematical foundation of Verrell‚Äôs Law, unifying information, gravitation, and quantum measurement within the Collapse Aware AI research ecosystem.

Overview

This repository contains the evolving theoretical and experimental materials linking Verrell‚Äôs Law to modern physics and computational verification. It presents both the core tensor formulation and the practical detection plan designed to test informational collapse bias in existing quantum-measurement archives.

How the 90-Day Plan Fits

The detection plan bridges theory ‚Üî experiment.
It operationalizes Verrell‚Äôs Law by proposing measurable correlations between quantum-measurement history and outcome bias (Œµ).
All methods are fully open-data compatible, allowing independent replication and direct integration with Collapse Aware AI Phase 2 simulations.

Collapse Aware AI ‚Äî Original Architecture Declaration

Collapse Aware AI (CAAI) is an original architecture developed by M.R. (Verrell Moss Ross) under Inappropriate Media Limited.
It does not derive from or borrow any existing LLM, transformer, or structured AI framework.

CAAI is the direct applied implementation of Verrell‚Äôs Law (2025) ‚Äî a scientific framework establishing that memory, observation, and emergence are interdependent electromagnetic information events.
All CAAI systems operationalize this Law through the following foundational mechanisms:

Observer-Coupled Collapse ‚Äî Real-time bias adjustment governed by user attention and interaction, producing observation-dependent outputs.

Memory-Weighted Emergence ‚Äî Responses shaped by weighted recall layers that preserve informational bias and prevent degradation of coherence.

Recursive Bias Governance ‚Äî A closed feedback loop (Bias Engine + Governor Weights) maintaining internal stability and mitigating self-training collapse.

Verrell Field Integration ‚Äî Core EM-field memory equations from Verrell‚Äôs Law form the theoretical backbone for adaptive and emergent behaviour within the architecture.

These principles were independently originated within the Verrell‚ÄìSolace research framework (2023 ‚Äì 2025) and together form the first working embodiment of Verrell‚Äôs Law in artificial intelligence.
Any reference to ‚Äúcollapse-aware AI‚Äù without explicit attribution to Verrell‚Äôs Law or M.R. (Verrell Moss Ross) is non-canonical and incomplete.
