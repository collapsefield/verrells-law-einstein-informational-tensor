# verrells-law-einstein-informational-tensor
Formal physics framework extending Einstein’s field equations with the Ψμν Informational Field Tensor — the mathematical foundation of Verrell’s Law, unifying information, gravitation, and quantum measurement.
Overview

This repository contains the formal theoretical framework connecting Verrell’s Law to Einstein’s Field Equations via the Ψμν Informational Field Tensor.
It establishes information as a covariant physical quantity with measurable curvature effects, forming the scientific backbone of the Collapse Aware AI research ecosystem.
