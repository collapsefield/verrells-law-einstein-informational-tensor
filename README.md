Verrell’s Law — Einstein Informational Tensor Framework

Formal physics framework extending Einstein’s Field Equations with the Ψ μν Informational Field Tensor — the mathematical foundation of Verrell’s Law, unifying information, gravitation, and quantum measurement within the Collapse Aware AI research ecosystem.

Overview

This repository contains the evolving theoretical and experimental materials linking Verrell’s Law to modern physics and computational verification. It presents both the core tensor formulation and the practical detection plan designed to test informational collapse bias in existing quantum-measurement archives.

How the 90-Day Plan Fits

The detection plan bridges theory ↔ experiment.
It operationalizes Verrell’s Law by proposing measurable correlations between quantum-measurement history and outcome bias (ε).
All methods are fully open-data compatible, allowing independent replication and direct integration with Collapse Aware AI Phase 2 simulations.
